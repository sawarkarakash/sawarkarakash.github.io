## 👋 About Me

I’m a Ph.D. scholar at the **Centre for the Study of Regional Development (CSRD), Jawaharlal Nehru University**, New Delhi. My research focuses on **poverty, inequality**, and the application of **advanced statistical techniques** like **Small Area Estimation (SAE)** to generate granular, actionable insights for public policy in India.

I actively work with large-scale national datasets such as the **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)**, **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)**, and **National Family Health Survey (NFHS)**. I aim to bridge economics, data science, and public policy through reproducible research using **R**.

I hold a **Master’s in Economics** from the **Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy**, and a **Bachelor’s in Economics** from **D.G. Ruparel College**, University of Mumbai.

Previously, I worked as a **Consultant** with the **Tribal Development Department, Government of Maharashtra**, contributing to the policy evaluation of educational initiatives like **Ashram Schools**.

## 📚 Publications & Writing

I’ve co-authored **books in Marathi** with **Prof. Neeraj Hatekar** on **unemployment in Maharashtra**, using data from the **PLFS**. These books aim to translate complex labour market statistics into accessible language for broader regional audiences, contributing to informed discussions on employment policy.

I'm also writing a **hands-on guidebook** on how to use Indian secondary datasets (PLFS, HCES, Time Use Survey) in **R**. It covers everything from data extraction and variable creation to weighting and estimation techniques tailored for applied economic research.
